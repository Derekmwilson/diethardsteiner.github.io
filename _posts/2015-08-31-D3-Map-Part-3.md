Welcome to the third part of my series focused on **D3JS**. While [Part 1](http://diethardsteiner.github.io/d3/2015/06/06/D3-Map-Part-1.html) explained the fundamentals, [Part 2](http://diethardsteiner.github.io/d3/2015/07/28/D3-Map-Part-2.html) focused on integrating the **D3 Map** with **dynamic data feeds** from the **Pentaho BA Server**. In Part 3 we will focus on **D3** again: I prepared a standalone **HTML** version of the final map shown in the Part 2 article (focusing only on displaying the election winners). To this map we will add **Tooltips** and a **Zoom** function.

 
# The Basics

As mentioned early, I prepared a new example, which shows the winning party by constituency. I would like to discuss first how this was implemented:

This time there are **two data files** to load:

- the **map** file
- the **election data** file

To make sure that all these data is loaded before generating the map, we make use of the [queue.js](https://github.com/mbostock/queue) asynchronous helper library.

Once the files are loaded, the `ready` function is called. The code block within the ready function is fairly similar to the code we generated in the first article, although some adjustments have been made. One of them is that we join the datasets using a `forEach` loop with a nested `filter` function.

# Adding Country Boundaries 

[OPEN] Not implemented yet, only partly in uk-election-winners-5-click-to-zoom.html - has to be adjusted for countries.

Another nice thing to have on our map would be the country borders. In this case there is also no need to create individual geometries for each country - we just want to show all the borders. 

Let's add a new **style** for the country borders:

```css
.country-borders{
    fill: none;
    stroke: #fff;
    stroke-width: 0.25px;
    stroke-linejoin: round;
    stroke-linecap: round;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

We nest our constituency polygons in an **svg group** and add an extra svg group for the country borders. **TopoJSON** features the [mesh function](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-mesh), which will create a multiline geometry representing the borders. We will also apply the `filter` function to not draw any borders along the coastline (in other words, if a country does not border another country, we will not draw a border):

```javascript
// draw borders seperately to not get any overlapping borders
var countriesBorders = topojson.mesh(topology, topology.objects.countries, function(a, b) { return a !== b; });

g.append("path")
    .datum(countriesBorders)
    .attr("class", "country-borders")
    .attr("d", path);
```

# Adding a Tooltip

First we add a `div` to the map:

```javascript
var tooltip = d3.select('#map').append('div')
    .attr('class', 'tooltip')
;
```

Within the ready function we then adjust the part paths for the constituencies: We add on `mousemove` and `mouse out` events to show and hide the tooltip respectively.

```javascript
// create a polygon for every constituency
svg.selectAll('.constituency')
.data(constituencies)
.enter()
.insert('path')
// assign id from feature data
.attr('id', function(d) { return d.id; })
//.attr('class', 'constituency')
.attr('d', path)
.attr('class', function(d){
    return (d.partyName).toLocaleLowerCase().replace(' ','-')
        + ' constituency';
})
// tooltip
.on('mousemove', function(d,i){
    var mouse = d3.mouse(svg.node()).map(
        function (d) {
            return parseInt(d);
        }
    )
    ;
    
    tooltip
        .classed('hidden', false)
        .attr('style', 'left:' + (mouse[0]+25) + 'px; top:' + mouse[1] + 'px')
        // tooltip text:
        .html(
            '<b>' + d.constituencyName + '</b></br>' 
            + d.partyName + '</br>' 
            + d.shareVotes + '%'
        )
    
})
.on('mouseout', function(d,i){
    tooltip.classed('hidden', true)
})
;
```

Finally we also add the required CSS styles:

```css
.hidden {
    display: none;
}

div.tooltip {
    color: #222;
    background: #fff;
    padding: .5em;
    text-shadow: #f5f5f5 0 1px 0;
    border-radius: 2px; 
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px 0px #a6a6a6; 
    opacity: 0.9; 
    position: absolute;
}
```

With a few lens of code we just created a very nice tooltip - who imagined it was that easy?!

# Adding a Zoom Function

## Basic Zoom

Here we will simply make use of the [D3 Zoom Behavior](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Zoom-Behavior) feature.

The first approach will be very simple and supports zooming via double tapping on the trackpad or vertical double finger swipe technique:

```javascript
var svg = d3.select('#map').append('svg')
    .attr('width', width)
    .attr('height', height)
    // for zoom
    .call(d3.behavior.zoom().on('zoom', redraw))
    ;
    
function redraw() {
    svg.attr('transform', 'translate(' + d3.event.translate + ') scale(' + d3.event.scale + ')');
}
```


An alternative approach is shown here: [Map Pan & Zoom II](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/eec4a6cda2f573574a11)

## Zoom Slider

You are certainly familiar with the + / - zoom functions of online maps like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. We want to replicate this basic zoom function for our map:

Possible Example: https://gist.github.com/mbostock/6242308

File: uk-election-winners-3-basic-zoom.html

## Click on Constituency Triggers Zoom (Click to Zoom)

Use case: On page load the whole map is displayed. When the end user clicks on a particular constituency, the specific area should be enlarged.

I slightly changed the main code and added the following (most important points only): 

1. Create a CSS style to highlight the selected constituency. We simply change the opacity of the background color to 80%.
	
	```css
	.active {
    fill-opacity: 0.8;
	}
	```
	
2. Defined a global variable called `centered` with no value.
3. Created a global `clicked` function.

	```javascript
	function clicked(d) {
		  var x, y, k;

		  if (d && centered !== d) {
		      var centroid = path.centroid(d);
		      x = centroid[0];
		      y = centroid[1];
		      k = 4;
		      centered = d;
		  } else {
		      x = width / 2;
		      y = height / 2;
		      k = 1;
		      centered = null;
		  }

		  g.selectAll("path")
		      .classed("active", centered && function(d) { return d === centered; });

		  g.transition()
		      .duration(750)
		      .attr("transform", "translate(" + width / 2 + "," + height / 2 + ")scale(" + k + ")translate(" + -x + "," + -y + ")")
		      .style("stroke-width", 1.5 / k + "px"); 
	}
	```
	
4. Added a `click` event to the `svg` element as well as to all `path` elements.
	
	```
	.on('click', clicked);
	```

File: uk-election-winners-5-click-to-zoom.html

All changes are based on [this example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2206590).

## Click on External Link Triggers Zoom

Use case: Via a drop down list the end user can pick one constituency and the map is supposed to zoom in on this constituency. You can find a good example [here](http://www.larsko.org/v/igdp/)

NEW BLOG POST ABOUT SIMPLIFYING

# Simplifying the topography file

[OPEN] read: http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-12-07
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18900022/topojson-quantization-vs-simplification

[OPEN] TopoJSON also has a `presimplify` function, which allows you to dynamicly simplify the mapping data based e.g. on zoom level. See [this example](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/7755778). This uses canvas.

Example using svg: [Line Simplification](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/)


What about the `presimplify` function: 

//simplify topology
    topojson.presimplify(topology);

There is also an option via the command line using the `topojson` command with the `-s` for simplify flag ([source](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5557726)):

```bash
topojson \
    --width 960 \
    --height 800 \
    --margin 20 \
    -s .25 \
    -o ca.json \
    -- counties=counties-projected.shp
```


| method | environment 
|  ------	| ------	|  
| topojson.simplify | server side (nodejs?)  
| topojson.presimplify | client side (browser)

## Best approach

1. Upload it to [Mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org) and use their simplify function. Make sure you click the **Repair** feature if available. Download as GeoJSON so that we can still define the id etc. (See if you can do a similar thing in QGIS).
2. Use the topojson command to convert GeoJSON file.
3. Remove transform (scale, translate) at the end of the file.

QGIS: Vector > Geometry Tools > Simplify Geometries: Hm, not really great results

## Alternative

The topojson file is still fairly large, let's try simplifying it further. The excellent article [Spatial data on a diet: tips for file size reduction using TopoJSON](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/04/22/spatial-data-on-a-diet-tips-for-file-size-reduction-using-topojson/) by Zav Ross outlines a few possibilties to slim down the file:

```
topojson \
  --id-property PCON13CDO \
  --properties name=PCON13NM \
  -q 5000 \
  -s 1e-8 \
  -o constituencies.topo.json \
  constituencies.json
```

If we check the file size now, we see that our topojson file only takes up only 1.4MB now.

```
topojson \
  --id-property PCON13CDO \
  --properties name=PCON13NM \
  -q 5000 \
  -s 1e-8 \
  -o constituencies.topo.json \
  constituencies.json
```

Always check the output. It is very easy to "destroy" the map by using too much simplification - always properly check the output.
