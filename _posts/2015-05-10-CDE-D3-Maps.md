# D3 Maps

The first part of this tutorial follows Mike Bostock's excellent [Let's make a map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) tutorial.

## Considerations

We want:

- a map which loads fast (**vector map**)
- map data to be stored on the server (instead of being dependent on an external service like Google Maps etc)

## Initial Setup

Install **GDAL**: Download your OS specific version from [here](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries).

> **Note**: On **Federa** execute `sudo yum install gdal.x86_64`. On **Mac OS X** you can use **Homebrew** to install GDAL: `brew install gdal`

Install **NodeJS**.

Install **TopoJSON** via the Node Package Manager:

```
$ sudo npm install -g topojson
```

Verify installation:

```
$ which ogr2ogr
/usr/local/bin/ogr2ogr
$ which topojson
/usr/local/bin/topojson
```


Converting Shapefiles to GeoJSON to TopoJSON

[TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki) (developed by Mike Bostock) allows us to minify GeoJSON files.

Download these files:

- [Admin 0 - Details - map subunits](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_admin_0_map_subunits.zip)
- [Populated Places](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_populated_places.zip)

Extract these zip files and then run the commands inside the extracted folders (otherwise you will get an error):

Run the next command inside the `ne_10m_admin_0_map_subunits` to extract the countery shapes for Great Britain and Ireland:

```
ogr2ogr
  -f GeoJSON \
  -where "ADM0_A3 IN ('GBR', 'IRL')" \
  subunits.json \
  ne_10m_admin_0_map_subunits.shp
```

Run the next command inside the `ne_10m_populated_places` folder to extract the major cities:

```
ogr2ogr \
  -f GeoJSON \
  -where "ISO_A2 = 'GB' AND SCALERANK < 8" \
  places.json \
  ne_10m_populated_places.shp
```

Copy both output files (`subunits.json` and `places.json`) into a dedicated directory and merge them with following command:

```
topojson \
  -o uk.json \
  --id-property SU_A3 \
  --properties name=NAME \
  -- \
  subunits.json \
  places.json
```

> **Shapefile**: Shapefiles can store all the commonly used spatial geometries (points, lines, polygons) along with the attributes to describe these features. Unlike other vector formats, a shapefile comes as a set of three or more files – the mandatory .shp, .shx, .dbf and the optional .prj file The .shp file holds the actual geometries, the .shx is an index which allows you to ‘seek’ the features in the shapefile, the .dbf file stores the attributes and the .prj file specifies the projection the geometries are stored in. ([Source](http://geohackers.in/2013/11/spatial-data-formats-101/))

If shapefiles do not sound familiar to you, chances are you really would like to understand what to do with them. If you try opening this kind of file with a text editor, you will realized that this is a binary file type. So we have to find a program/app which can handle shapefiles. There are two **GIS** open source projects which I came across: 

- [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
- [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org)

We will be using QGIS. Pay attention to [install instructions](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#linux). On Fedora, all I had to do was to install the client tools like so:

```
$ sudo yum update
$ sudo yum install qgis qgis-python 
```

The **QGIS Desktop** app will allow us to visualize the shapefile and manipulate it using the GUI, which provides instant feedback - in a nutshell: It will allow spatial geo newbies like us to work more efficiently.

Open the **QGIS Desktop** app. 

Right click on our map layer and choose **Filter**. In the **Query Builder** look for `ADM0_A3` from **Fields** and double click on it, which will populate the **Filter expression** box at the bottom. Complete the expression so that it looks like the one shown below:

```
"ADM0_A3"  IN  ('GBR', 'IRL')
```

Click **OK** and the map should show only the UK and Ireland now.

Next click on the **Add Vector Layer** and choose the populated places shape file. In the **Layers** panel right click on the populated places layer and choose **Filter**. Set the expression to:

```
ISO_A2 = 'GB' AND SCALERANK < 8
```

We can also add some labels if we wanted to: Right click on the populated places layer and choose **Properties** and then **Labels**. Tick **Label this layer with** and choose `Name`. Below this option you'll find some formatting options: Choose **Buffer** and tick **Draw text buffer**. Your map should look like this now:

![]()


??We can also join these two layers: Right click on the populated places layer and choose **Properties** and then **Joins**. Click the green plus icon and choose `SU_A3` as join field and `NAME` as target field. Click OK.

So that's enough playing around with shapefiles for now. Let's focus on the task at hand.

The [Office of National Statistics website](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/electoral/westminster-parliamentary-constituencies/index.html) points to [this page](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page). Choose Download Products > Boundaries. Here we have the option to download [Boundaries : Westminster_parliamentary_constituencies_(GB)_2013_Boundaries_(Full_Extent).zip](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/Docs/Boundaries/Westminster_parliamentary_constituencies_(GB)_2013_Boundaries_(Full_Extent).zip) - but the simplified version will do actually: [Boundaries : Westminster_parliamentary_constituencies_(GB)_2013_Boundaries_(Generalised_Clipped).zip](Boundaries : Westminster_parliamentary_constituencies_(GB)_2013_Boundaries_(Generalised_Clipped).zip). Unzip the file and load the shapefile into **QGIS** to check that this is map contains what we are looking for. Indeed it does! Only Northern Ireland is missing - but we ignore this problem for this exercise as we only have limited time.

Another resource is [here](http://data.gov.uk/data/search?q=Parliamentary+constituencies).

London Election [results data](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/general-election-results-2015)

```
ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON constituencies.json PCON_DEC_2013_GB_BGC.shp
topojson -o constituencies.topo.json constituencies.json
```

The topojson file is still fairly large, let's try simplifying it further ([Source](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/48827/how-to-avoid-corrupt-geometries-when-translating-between-topojson-and-geojson)):

```
topojson -q 1e2 -o constituencies.topo.json constituencies.json
```



... create `index.html`

We have to tell D3 which data to use. Looking at our topojon file, the data points would come from `object.constituencies`:

```
{"type":"Topology","objects":{"constituencies":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{
```

With this knowledge we can start writing our D3 code:

```javascript
d3.json("constituenciestopo.json", function(error, uk) {
    if (error) return console.error(error);

    svg.append("path")
        // adjust topology reference
        .datum(topojson.feature(uk, uk.objects.constituencies))
      .attr("d", d3.geo.path().projection(d3.geo.mercator()));
});
```


To test the HTML page we need a webserver as there are restrictions loading JSON files from the local file system. If you have NodeJS installed you can install `http-server` via **npm**:

```
sudo npm install http-server -g
```

Now run this in the same directory as the HTML file is located in:

```
http-server -p 8008 &
```

Open `http://0.0.0.0:8008` in your favourite web browser.

> **Note**: If **Chrome** shows this error in the JS console ` Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of undefined` then you are referencing an object that doesn't exist in your topology. ([Source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15509493/topojson-js187-uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-type-of-undefined)). **Firefox** displayed the same error as: `TypeError: t is undefined`.
